            We've all heard the story; your computer worked great when it was new, but that was years ago. You've tried all the tips and tricks you could find to speed it up and make it run better but there's only so much you can do with "ancient" hardware. Now it's so slow and frustrating to use that it's starting to collect dust. The only option left is to buy a new computer with the latest Apple or Microsoft operating system (OS) and give your old computer to whichever family member will take it.<br><br>

            It doesn't have to be that way! Your current computer hardware can still run like new! Commercial software comes bloated with unnecessary features that eat up your computer's limited resources and degrade performance. Apple and Microsoft don't seem to mind that bloated software updates often cause poor performance on older computersâ€¦ After all, the slower your computer gets, the more likely you are to buy a new one (which will come pre-installed with a paid-for license of their latest OS)! <br><br>

            At Hardware Rescue we install the best free and open source software available on your computer - Linux. Linux is an operating system (like Microsoft's Windows or Apple's MacOS) that has been around for decades. What we know of as Linux today was created in 1991 by a Finnish student, Linus Torvalds, as a personal project for a completely free and open source operating system (all of the source code is freely available, unlike Microsoft's or Apple's proprietary code) that could be used by anyone. This small project quickly gained the support of thousands of geeks the world over. They, and Linus, have continued to improve and streamline it ever since.<br><br>

            Linux's small footprint, rock solid reliability, and excellent virus protection have made it the backbone of countless enterprise server applications for years. However, thanks to its longstanding (and often deserved) reputation for being more complicated to install and use than Windows or MacOS, it hasn't ever really been a threat to Microsoft and Apple's dominance in the personal desktop computer market - until now.<br><br>

            <img src="img/laptoplogor.png" class="img-fluid float-right ml-3 mb-3">We do all the tricky stuff for you! Once configured and set up correctly, a desktop computer running Linux is incredibly simple to understand and easy to use. Efficiency is built into the system from the ground up - you will feel the difference. The computer boots faster, applications take less time to launch, everything is just smoother. Linux is an operating system perfectly suited for those who need a simple, reliable computer that well protected from viruses and malware for their home office and online needs.<br><br>

            We will help you remove your costly, poorly performing proprietary operating system, and replace it with a sleek and efficient version of Linux. We will stand behind this software and help you as you delve into the world of free and open source software. We will be a click or a phone call away if you need any assistance. We want you to love Linux as much as we do, and we're confident that you will.
